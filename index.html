									<p>
										Ruin the World was a project that was made in a game jam, the theme of the jam was, Save yourself not the world.
										The main idea behind this game is that you play a female character that tries to save herself from a destructive world.
										The world is being destroyed by unknown forces and you need to save yourself from destruction! As Commander Gonzales, your only objective is to survive!
										Try to survive as long as possible in this endless run game. The world is burning behind you as you are trying to pass obstacles in fornt of you.
										I was very happy to finish my first mobile game, I and my team won that game jam even though the competition was fierce.
										After that mobile game, we started to work on another called Slav quest which was a fun drinking game.

										Just Photo Cat is a game that was made for Ludum dare game jam the theme of the jam was deeper and deeper.
										This project involved 5 people including me as an audio designer.
										The game was made in 48 hours, after the game was finished it contained some bugs, we fixed most of them but still, some of them remained.
										As this project was only made for the game jam we didn’t work much on it as we wanted to make a game that we could put in our portfolio.

										Mori is a game a about reaper named Mori. You start your journey as an apprentice to a more experienced reaper who guides you through the world of the undead. Your main task as a reaper is to collect souls that have passed away while looking at the history of each soul's life. Don't think your task is going to be easy as collecting souls is only one part of your job, you also need to find a villan that is bringin souls back to life and making them imortal so they cant find their resting place.

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Beer_Game_Image.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Beer game is a simple mobile game that I have made for one brewery in Croatia. This game was made in unity, the entire game is pixel-like.
										The goal of the game is to fill the cup that is on the table. To progress to the next level you need to fill a cup to a certain point if you fail to do so you lose and you have to start over. As you progress through the levels each of these levels will get more difficult.
