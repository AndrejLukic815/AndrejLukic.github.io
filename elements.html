							<h2>My previous work</h2>
							<p>
								Before I was a Game Developer I work as a 112 operator in my hometown.
								From a young age, I wanted to make games so I decided to quit my job and start my journey as a Game Developer.
								I first started to make games just to practice and didn’t quite make any money on these games.
								Later I found out that there is an education in Novska that teaches people how to be Game Developers.
								So I applied and got accepted. After a couple of months, I make my first money by creating a realistic simulator.
								On 13 of Jun 2021, I participated in the Hackathon game jam that was organized by GameChuck and ManpowerGroup.
								I and my team won that competition and earn some money and on top of that made some business deals along the way.

							<h2>Education</h2>
							<p>
								I have graduated from law school in Croatia in 2018, 2 years later I have applied for a job as a 112 operator in my hometown.
								In 2020 I got a degree in my profession as after one year on probation work I had to take an exam for this position.
								When 2021 came along I started to participate in 6 month-long education about Game Development.
								1 of August 2021 I finished education and got a diploma in Game Development.

								<h2>My accomplishments</h2>
								<p>
									I have participated in many game jams that include locally in my community or global games jams in a variety of game jam themes.
									Recently in Croatia ManpowerGroup and GameChuck organized a game jam with a theme to make a simulation in Unity.
									I and my team won that competition and were also rewarded with a bonus place for the most innovative and realistic simulation in that competition.
									The purpose of this competition is to reward the best team with a cash reward and also offer them an opportunity to work on this project from the competition.
