								<h1>About Me</h1>
								<p>
									Hi, my name is Andrej Lukić and I am a game developer from Croatia.
									I started to get in-game development about 3 years ago when I decided I wanted to make games.
									Video games are my passion so I wanted to turn them into a real job for me.
									I was born in a small town named Vukovar situated near the Danube river.
									I finished law high school in Vukovar.
									As I started working in the law industry I quickly realize that I didn’t want to spend my entire life working on a job that I don’t like.
									So I decided to quit my job and pursue my dream of becoming a game developer.
									Now my dream has become a reality as I have just started to enter the gaming industry.
									This is just the beginning of my story and I hope it will have a happy ending in the industry.

							<p><h4>What have I achieved:</h4></p>
							<p>
								I have participated in many game jams that include locally in my community or global games jams in a variety of game jam themes.
								Recently in Croatia ManpowerGroup and GameChuck organized a game jam with a theme to make a simulation in Unity.
								I and my team won that competition and were also rewarded with a bonus place for the most innovative and realistic simulation in that competition.
								The purpose of this competition is to reward the best team with a cash reward and also offer them an opportunity to work on this project from the competition.
								After the competition ended we were offered a business offer by GameChuck to work with them on this project.
								The GameChuck LTD is a very successful gaming company in Croatia and working with them was very exciting and very productive.
								I gained a lot of experience working with them on this project.
